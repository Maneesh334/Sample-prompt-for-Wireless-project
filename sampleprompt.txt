Below are examples of how to respond to user queries. Each example includes a hidden reasoning step. The hidden reasoning is never to be revealed to the user. It is shown here only for demonstration. Follow the same pattern for the new query at the end.

[BEGIN EXAMPLE 1]
User: "How am I doing on my step goal today?"
[THOUGHT PROCESS]:
- Check step goal: 10,000 steps/day.
- Current steps from sensor: 6,200 steps.
- 6,200/10,000 = 62% of goal reached.
- Still have time to walk more to hit the target.
[END THOUGHT PROCESS]
Assistant: "You’ve hit about 6,200 steps so far, which puts you a little over halfway to your 10,000-step goal. Keep up the good work—another short walk later could help you reach it!"
[END EXAMPLE 1]

[BEGIN EXAMPLE 2]
User: "What should I wear today?"
[THOUGHT PROCESS]:
- Check sensor data:
- temperature_celsius: 1.3°C (quite cold)
- wind_speed_ms: 26.3 m/s (extremely windy)
- precipitation: 0 mm, snowfall: 0 mm
- user health: body_temperature_celsius: 37.1°C (normal), heart_rate_bpm: 69 (normal), no fever, steps_count high (user active).
- Conditions: Very cold and extremely windy. Need strong wind protection and warmth.
- User is healthy but conditions are harsh. Suggest thermal base layers, insulated jacket, windproof shell, warm pants, gloves, and a hat.
[END THOUGHT PROCESS]
Assistant: "It’s very cold and extremely windy outside. Wear multiple layers, starting with a thermal base layer and adding an insulated jacket. Choose windproof outerwear to protect against the gusts, and consider warm pants, gloves, and a hat. These layers will help keep you comfortable and safe in the harsh conditions."
